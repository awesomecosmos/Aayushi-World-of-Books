# My-Book-Stats
Descriptive statistics and analytics of my book obsession.

## Objectives
- To create a dashboard (RShiny or Dash) which displays statistics and visualizations of my reading habits. 
- To create some sort of permanent data collection method for me which is:
  - easily accessible
  - minimal data entry required
  - automatically is able to find metadata about the book (perhaps using ISBN as linking factor?)

## Statistics and Visualizations
- Avg. and Total books read in a selected time range
- number of books read over time (line and bar)
- number of books read over time by genre/other filter

## possible Metadata APIs
- https://developers.google.com/books/
- https://openlibrary.org/developers/api
- http://bms.bowker.com/help/
